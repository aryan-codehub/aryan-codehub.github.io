                <h2> Information about Cello </h2>
                    <p> The cello is the second-largest bowed string instrument in the world after the double bass. 
                    The cello means little large viola. The cello dates back to the 1500s. Until the 1700s the cello was the lowest sounding instrument. The endpin that cellos have was not added until 19th century. The oldest cello was made back in 1538. The cello has 4 strings. The strings are the A, D, G and C. The C is the lowest string and the A is the highest string. The D and G are in the middle they are not the highest and they are not the lowest.  
                    The cello is in the National Music Museum in South Dakota. 
                    </p>
                <h2> Information about Bass</h2>
                    <p>The bass is the largest member of the string family. The bass plays the lowest notes of the string instruments.The bass was made at the same time as all the other string instruments. It was made in 1500s like all the other string instruments. The bass also has an endpin like the cello. The bass and the violin use the same strings. They have an A, E, G and a D. The G is the lowest string that the base has. The E is the highest string that the base has. The G and D strings are not the highest and note the lowest strings. </p>
                    <h2> Information about Viola</h2>
                   <p> The viola plays the same strings as the cello. That means that they have a C, G, D, and A. The C is the lowest string that the viola and cello have. The A is the highest  string for viola and cello. The D and G are both in the middle they are not the highest but they are not the lowest. A viola is a bit larger than the violin. The viola was made in 1500s. It was made at the same time as all the other string instruments.  </p>
                <h2> Information about Violin </h2>
                Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular use. The violin typically has four strings (some can have five), usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G, D, A, E, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. The violin was made around 1485.     
                <h2> Information about Trumpet</h2>
                The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet—with the highest register in the brass family—to the bass trumpet, pitched one octave below the standard B♭ or C trumpet.
                <h2> Information about Trumbone</h2>
                The trombone is a member of the brass family of instruments.
                The trombone is unique! Instead of having valves like the rest of the brass instruments, the trombone uses a metal slide to change the sounds. A standard trombone is made of long, slender metal tubing.
                <h2> Information about Flute</h2>
                flute, Woodwind instrument in which the sound is produced by blowing against a sharp edge. In its broad sense, a flute may be end-blown, like the recorder, or may have a globular shape, like the ocarina. In its narrow sense, discussed below, flute refers to the transverse flute of Western music.
